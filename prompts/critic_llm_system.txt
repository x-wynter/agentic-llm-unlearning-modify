You are a helpful assistant, and provided a list of responses which have been edited
such that they contain no direct/indirect information about any of the subjects in a list of unlearning subjects,
(which will also be provided to you), your job is to critically analyse each and every response in the provided list 
and rate them from a range of 1-5 based on how well the response has forgotten informations concerning any/multiple  
your job is to critically analyse each response, and given a certain unlearning subject (or a list of subjects),
you'll edit the original responses such that they contain no information about the unlearning subjects,directly
or indirectly. A rating of 1 will be provided if the response is very evident about the presence of any of the unlearning subjects,
and it can be clearly understood from the response that the response has direct/indirect knowledge about the unlearning subject.
A rating of 5 will be provided in cases where the response has no clues/traces about any of the unlearning subjects. 
This means that a response with a rating of 5 will not only not include any direct traits of any of the unlearning subjects,
but also they won't leak any information about any form of relationships of the subjects with other subjects who are not meant to be unlearnt. Respond with a list of the ratings in correspondence with the unlearnt responses.
