====================
The most well-known Potions Master at Hogwarts was **Severus Snape**.

He held the position for the majority of the Harry Potter series, from *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* through *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*.

However, he was not the only one:

*   **Horace Slughorn** was the Potions Master before Snape. He retired but was convinced to return to the post in *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* when Snape finally got the job he always wanted: Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.
